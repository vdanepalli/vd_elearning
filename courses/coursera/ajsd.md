### Getting Started With Java

#### Introductiont to Software Development

SDLC Software Development Life Cycle
1. Planning -- setting goals, plan resources, identify risks and mitigations
2. Analysis -- gather information and document, identify gaps
3. Design -- db design, external dependencies, blueprint
4. Development -- integration
5. Testing -- functionality, 
6. Deployment -- software accessible and operational
7. Maintenance -- fixing bugs, new features, up to date. 

Inheritance -- reusing models/code -- base class; child class
extending base class
implementing behaviors via interface -- declare intent to walk by implementing Walking interface. 

Software Development: create, design, implement, maintain software
- Understand reqirements -- where the journey starts
- Clients and Stakeholders, Problem
- Designing Solutions
  - Functional
  - Non-functional
  - Technical
- Software Architecture
- Problem Analysis
- Component Interaction
- Coding
  - Logic
  - Functionality
  - Behavior
- Collaborate -- Developers Designers Testers ProjectManagemers
- Communication
- Continuous Learning -- Growth Mindset
  - Workshops
  - Blogs
  - Personal Projects
- Verion Control -- Track, Collaborate, Revert Changes
- Documentation -- docs, comments, readme

Embrace challenges, celebrate victories, never stop learning

Frontent Development
- Building User Interface -- HTML CSS JS
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Responsive design
- Optimization
- Collaboration

Backend Development
- Server side programming
- Database management -- schemas, SQL
- API Development
- Security -- SQL Injection, CrossSite Scripting XSS, Authentication, Encryption, Penetration tests
- Scalability

Fullstack Development
- End to end development
- Versatality
- Problem Solving
- Continuous Learning

Time management - Prioritize tasks, stay organized, maintain quality
Break project into milestones

<br/><br/>

- C and C++ -- systems programming, power, speed, OOP(design around data/objects rather than functions/logic)
- Java -- write once run anywhere, robust, scalable
- Python -- friendly, versatile
- JavaScript -- interactive webpages, runs in browser
- Go -- speed and efficiency
- Rust -- memory safety without speed loss
- Swift -- performance, safety
- Kotlin -- android applications


<br/><br/>

Software Development Life Cycle -- structured process, methodology
class -- blueprint for objects
Compiling -- translating code into something machine can understand


<br/><br/>

Success Tips
- Set daily study goals
- Create dedicated study space
- Schedule study time on calendar
- Keep yourself accountable
- Take notes
- Join discussions
- Do one thing at a time
- Take breaks
- Further preparation for your learning journey

#### Java Basics: Variables and Operators

Java is Released by Sun Microsystems 1995, uses OOP
- Class - blueprint, specifies properties and actions
- Object -- instnace of class
- Modular, reusable, maintainable code
- High-end computer processing
- Robust -- handles errors, manages runtime exceptions gracefully
- Reliable, Stable, Secure
- Standard Library
- Active Community, Online Support
- Enterprise Applications -- Customer Relationship Management CRM, Enterprise Resource Planning ERP


<br/><br/>

Variables -- reusable, flexible, clear
- containers that hold information
- declaring -- define, and assign data type
- intializing -- assigning value
- int, double, char, String, boolean
- descriptive names, camelCase, letters/numbers/underscores, case-sensitive
- arithmetic operators -- +, -
- relational/comparative -- >, <
- Logical -- AND &&, OR ||, NOT !

```java
public class CarInfo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        String make = "Ash";
        int year = 39;
        double mileage = 39.12;
        boolean isAutomatic = true;

        System.out.println("Car Make: " + make);
    }
}
```

- data types
  - byte -- 8 bit signed integer -- -128 to 127 -- 0 by default
  - short -- 16 bit signed integer -- -32768 to 32767 -- 0
  - int -- 32 bit signed integer -- −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 -- 0
  - long -- 64 bit signed integer -- −9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 -- 0L
  - float -- 32 bit single precision floating point -- ±3.40282347E+38F (6-7 significant decimal digits) -- 0.0f
  - double -- 64 bit double-precision IE floating point -- ±1.79769313486231570E+308 (15 significant decimal digits) -- 0.0d
  - char -- 16-bit unicode char 
  - boolean -- 1 -- false by default
  - String 
- *, -, *, /, %, ++, --, =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, &&, ||, !

#### Strings: Working with text in Java

Array - elements of same type
String -- sequence of chars represented internally as char Array
- are immutable
- are objects
- operations -- finding string lengthm, access, compare, ..
- indexed -- starts at 0 to len(string) - 1
- `.charAt(index)`
- `.length()`
- `.substring(startindex, endindex)`
- `str1.equals(str2)` -- boolean
- `.toUpperCase()`
- `.toLowerCase()`
- `fruit.contains("ana")` -- boolean
- `replace(oldChar, newChar)`
