### Structured Thinking

#### Overview of Data Science Projects


Data is becoming increasingly important. 
Tools and Techniques of Data Science are accessible.

A problem is a chance for you to do your best. 
Problem solving is a mindset.

#### Introduction to Structured Thinking

> Knowing how to think empowers you far beyond those who know only what to think

Structured Thinking
- Structured Framework
- Large problem to smaller problems
- Holistic, efficient, effective solutions

Problem Solving
- Define the problem -- problem statement worksheet, project briefing document, requirement documents
- Understanding root cause of the problem -- fishbone (ishikawa) diagram -- cause and effect, 5-whys framework
- Finding out solution to the problem -- issue trees, mindmaps, hypothesis tree, SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, Threat), Desirability-Feasibility-Viability 
- Implement the best possible solution to the problem

Solving Problem 
1. Research and Context -- analysis
2. Defining Problem Statement -- root cause
3. Identifying Potential Solutions
4. Choosing one to Implement

Be curious, learn domain, learn technologies

What problem we're solving, what are the components, which are the most important, what analytics should I apply, how do I synthesize this into a story


Focus on levers that are big and movable -- Prioritization

One-day answer or one-hour answer

Anchoring, Overoptimism, Availability bias (previous conception of the problem), Sunflower bias (biases based on hierarchies -- youngest changing to senior answers etc. )


Project Management
- Define Clear Objectives
- Breakdown and Prioritize Tasks
- Establish a Communication Plan
- Identify and Mitigate Risks
- Monitor and Track Progress
