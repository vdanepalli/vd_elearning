## ZTM: PyTorch for Deep Learning

### PyTorch Fundamentals

- ML is turning data into numbers and finding patterns in that numbers
- AI > ML > DL
- traditional -- inputs > rules > output
- ML -- inputs > outputs > rules

<br/><br/>

- simple rule-based system > ML 
- when
  - problems with long list of rules
  - continually changing environments
  - discovering insights within large collections of data
- when not
  - when you need explainability
  - when traditional approach is a better option
  - when errors are unacceptable
  - when you don't have much data
- ML - structured data -- shallow algorithms
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boost
  - Naive Bayes
  - Nearest Neighbors
  - Support Vector Machines
- DL - unstructured data
  - Neural Networks
  - CNNs
  - RNNs
  - Transformers


<br/><br/>

- Inputs -> Numerical Encoding -> Neural Networks (learns representation - patterns/features/weights) -> Representation outputs -> Outputs
- Input Layer (data goes in) -> Hidden Layer(s) (learns patterns in data) -> Output Layer (otputs learned representations or predicted probabilities)
- each layer is usually a combination of linear and non-linear functions
- types of learning
  - supervised -- data and labels (input - output mappings)
  - unsupervised & self-supervised -- data, no labels
  - transfer learning -- transferring patterns learned by a model over a dataset to another model
  - reinforcement learning -- agent actions rewards observations
- applications
  - recommendations
  - translation
  - speech recognition
  - computer vision
  - natural language processing
- types
  - classification/regression
  - sequence to sequence seq2seq


<br/><br/>

- PyTorch -- Deep Learning framework
  - pre-built models
  - whole stack -- pre-process, build, deploy
  - originally designed by Meta, now open-sourced
  - enables you to leverage GPU/TPU
- [AIML Research Papers - Paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com/)
- Tensor
  - Numerical Encoding and Representaion Outputs -- Tensors
  - Inputs -> Numerical Encoding -> Neural Networks (learns representation - patterns/features/weights) -> Representation outputs -> Outputs

1. Get Data Ready (turn into tensors)
2. Build or pick pre-trained Model (to suit your problem)
   1. Pick a loss function and optimizer
   2. Build a training loop
3. Fit the model to data and make prediction
4. Evaluate the model
5. Improve through experimentation
6. Save and reload your trained model


<br/><br/>

1. Code along
2. Explore and experiment
3. Visualize what you don't understand
4. Ask questions
5. Do the exercies
6. Share your work

- Start with random numbers (tensors) -> look at data -> update random numbers -> look at data -> update ....

random_image_size_tensor = torch.rand(size=(3, 224, 224)) # color channels height width

zeroes = torch.zeros(size=(3, 4))
ones = torch.ones(size=(3, 4))

ones.dtype # torch.float32

one_to_ten = torch.arange(1, 11, 2) # start end step
ten_zeros = torch.zeros_like(input=one_to_ten)

float_32_tensor = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3], 
    dtype = None, # defaults to float32 even when specified as None
    device = None, # defaults to cpu; can change to cuda for gpu; what device is your tensor on
    requires_grad = False # whether or not to track gradients with this tensors operation
)

float_16_tensor = float_32_tensor.type(torch.float16)

- 3 big errors
  - tensors not right data type
  - tesnors not right shape
  - tensors not on the right device
- tensor operations
  - addition `tensor + 10` -- add 10 to each element
  - subtraction 
  - multiplication (element-wise) `tensor * 10` -- multiply each element by 10 -- `torch.mul(tensor, 10)`
  - division
  - matrix multiplication (dot product) - `torch.matmul(tensor, tensor)` `tensor @ tensor` `torch.mm(tensor, tensor)`
    - inner dimensions must match 
    - result has shape of outer dimensions
