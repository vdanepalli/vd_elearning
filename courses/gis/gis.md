## ESRI: GIS Basics

- tools to solve spatial problems;
- GIS components: 
  - hardware (create, share, use)
  - software(store, analyze, display; input, manipulate, query)
  - data (location addr, postal codes, x, y )
  - people
  - workflows (processes and repeatable tasks)

<br/><br/>

- Geopgraphic Information
  - Attributes: non-location information, ID, names, values
  - Location:

<br/><br/>

- Spatial analytics - trends, patterns, relationships
- Field operations - 
- Mapping and visualization - spreadsheets, dbs, live feeds
- Real-time GIS - sensors or devices
- 3D GIS - 
- Imagery and remote sensing - 
- Data collection and management


<br/><br/>

- ArcGIS Online - Cloud based Web GIS deployment 
- ArcGIS Enterprise - within organization's firewall
- ArcGIS Pro - desktop application
- ArcGIS Mobile Apps

<br/><br/>

- Map presentations
  - Static maps
  - Dynamic maps - web maps and web apps

## ESRI: GIS Foundations

- What is GIS?
- intro and history
- ![](assets/2024-12-03-16-57-44.png)
- components: people, data, method (data analysis), hardware, software (tools)
- integrated db: roads, buildings, vegetation
> GIS is about uncovering meaning and insights from within data -- Jack Dangermond 

- data
  - vector 
    - discrete, doesn't continue across entire space
    - representation  
      - points 
      - line 
      - polygons
    - takes less memory
  - raster 
    - aka img -- grid of cells, called pixel 
    - each pixel is a DN - Digital Number -- proportional of light sensed by sensor over that pixel
