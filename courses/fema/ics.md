# Incident Command System

## ICS - 0100.c An Introduction to Incident Command System

- goals
- familiarize with ICS, and NIMS (National Incident Management System) principles

### ICS Overview

- 1970s, California wildfires. Different agencies couldn't talk the same language or work together effectively -- Costs time, resources, lives
- designed for everyone involved in emergency response


<br/><br/>

1. Standardization and Common Terminology
2. Management by Objectives
   1. clear, achievable goals -- Incident Commander sets the overall strategy for each operational period
3. Modular Organization and Span of Control -- not a one-size-fits-all rigid structure
   1. expands and contracts -- IC can delegate authority to major functional areas C-FLOP
      1. Operations
      2. Planning
      3. Logistics
      4. Finance/Administration
   2. can further divide into Brnaches, Divisions/Groups as needed with 3-7 people for team -- Span of Control
4. Incident Action Plan IAP -- objectives, strategies, tactics, resources, safety considerations
5. Comprehensive Resource Management -- identifying, ordering, mobilizing, tracking, recovering, demobilizing resources (personnel, teams, equipment, supplies, facilities)
6. Integrated Communications -- communication plan using clear text
7. Establishment and Transfer of Command
8. Unified Command UC -- single command, shared objectives
9. Chain of Command -- line of command and Unity of Command -- just one supervisor
10. Accountability -- adhering to policies, procedures, and checking in/out; supervisors for subordinates; check-in to demobilization

Big Picture for BI Specialist

1. Understanding Data context
2. Improving Data Quality
3. Supporting Decision Making
4. Post Incident Analysis and Improvement -- After Action Reviews AARs
5. Predictive Analytics


<br/><br/>


- Response problems could rarely be attributed to lack of resources or failure of tactics
- ICS was developed in 1970s. -- standardized approach
  - used for all kinds of incidents, by all organizations, at all government levels
  - for emergencies or planned-events
  - coordinated response across jurisdictions and agencies
  - common processes for incident-level planning and resource management
  - integration of resources (facilities/equipment/personnel)
  - provides organizational structure -- guides process for planning, building, and adapting that structure


<br/><br/>

- 1970s. Nobody was running same playbook. Wasn't about bravery or tactics. Coordination. 
- BI -- coordination facilitated by ICS 
  - key
    - cost savings
    - efficiency gains
    - resource usage
    - operational tempo
  - common/standardized -- reliable data; apples to apples
  - scalability and applicability = data variety
  - coordination and integration = data integration challenge
  - processes = data generation points 
- SITL
  - provide clear, accurate, timely information that prevents very coordination breakdowns ICS 
  - maps, status boards, reports
  - Standardization is mandatory
    - map symbols, terminology, ICS 209 Situation Report -- resource check-in forms
  - Scalability and Applicability = Flexible tools
    - whiteboard, digital mapping systems, status boards
  - Cooardination and Integration = Information Hub
    - Information/Updates --> Common Operating Picture (COP)
  - Processes = SITL Workflow 
    - gather intel to support Planning
    - resource status information. track resources against assignments
    - situation summaries for briefings and next IAP
  - Integration = Visualizing the Structure
    - who's assigned where -- Divisions/Groups, location of Key Facilities


<br/><br/>

- ICS as daily driver for managing incidents and events. 
- BI
  - Universal Application = Richer Data
    - resource allocation patterns across event types
    - costs associated with planned vs emergency operations
    - trends in reosurce needs based on location or event size
  - Structure and Process Guidance = Measurable Framework 
  - Practice = Performance Data
  - Skill Improvement = Quantifiable Progress
    - response times
    - resource accountability
    - cost per response hour
- SITL
  - Universal Application = Consistent Tools and Methods
  - Structure and Process Guidelines = SITL's Roadmap
    - structure -- what information to display
    - process -- how they fit into planning cycle
    - inputs -- intel, resource stats
    - outputs -- maps, situation reports, COP displays
  - Adapting Structure = Real-time updates
    - maps and organizational charts. keep COP accurate
  - Practice = Muscle memory
    - overcome information overload. debug processes in lower-stress environments

### Overview

ICS is a standardized management tool representing best practices

HSPD-5, Management of Doemstic Incidents -- DHS to form NRF and NIMS

HSPD-8, National Preparedness -- DHS to lead national initiative to develop national preparedness system -- unified, common

PPD-8, National Preparedness -- national whole community approach

NIMS components
- Resource Management
- Command and Coordination
- Communications and Information management

### Incident Command and Unified Command

Chain of Commnad
Unity of Command -- each and every one has only one supervisor
Unified Commnad -- when no particular one has authority or resources
- single Incident Command Post

Formal communication -- assignments, requesting resources, progress etc
Informal communication -- incident or event information

After-Action reports, foot messengers, alternate means of communication

Common Leadership Responsibilities
- Communicate -- instruct, feedback
- Supervise
- Evaluate
- Understand and Accept
- Ensure
- Take command
- Motivate
- Demonstrate

Know, understand, practice responsibilities
Commitment to duty, respect, and integrity
