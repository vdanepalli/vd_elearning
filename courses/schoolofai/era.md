## ERA V1

### S1 Fundamentals of AI

- Vision AI relied on Convolutions and NLP on RNN/LSTM architectures
- Since 2017, transformers changed everything -- Attention is all you need!; 
  - increase in parameters and data, accuracy increases -- linear; earlier, it wasn't like this
  - Encoder and Decoder
  - We do not need supervised data, model predicts the missing word -- fill in the blanks -- do not need to annotate data
    - hallucinations
- Multimodal models -- text audio video etc
- Loss functions -- model needs to learn the context;

  - Attention is all you need
  - YOLO - You Only Look Once
