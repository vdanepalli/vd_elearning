## Google: Machine Learning Crash Course

### Introduction

- ML -- train a piece of software called model (mathematical relationship derived from data) to make useful predictions or generate content
- Supervised - how data maps to correct answers
  - Regression -- predict numeric value
  - Classification -- predict a class/category
    - Binary 
    - Multi-class
  - concepts
    - Datasets are made up of individual examples that contain features and a label
      - size - number of examples 
      - diversity - range the examples cover
      - features 
    - Model
- Unsupervised -- identify patterns in data
  - Clustering
- Reinforcement -- predictions by getting rewards/penalties based on actions within an environment
  - generates a policy that defines strategy for getting most rewards
- Generative AI - class of models creating content
  - learn patterns in data with the goal to produce new but similar data
  - model learns to mimic the data it's trained on
  - trained as unsupervised, then optionally as supervised or reinforcement
