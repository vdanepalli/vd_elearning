# Personal Knowledge Base 🧠

Welcome! 👋 This repository is my personal space for collecting notes, code snippets, and summaries from my learning path across various sources like courses, articles, and books.

My primary goal is organization for quick reference. These notes are shared publicly in the hope they might be helpful to others on a similar path. `:-)`
